            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>The goal was to use basic HTML and basic CSS to create a webpage for a made up movie. I made this with my partner Andrea. We both didn't know what genre we wanted so I just said "action" and we went with that. 
               We made a planning page so we know what to do and so we meet all the requirements, the story and title for the movie was not conceived until the end, all we planned was how the webpage was going to look.
            Since I was on story duty, I came up with a retired hitman who cleans the city by slaughtering its criminals in a futuristic setting. </p>
            <p>The biggest challenge was communication, we never talked after school and we used the minimum amount of words to communicate during class. I was also absent one day so thats a whole day of no talking. The solution to
            this challenge was orginization, the planning page we made said everything we had to do so there was barely any need for communication. Using that planning page led me know what to work on when I was absent, and me not being completely lost. 
               Through this project I learned that, If you're organized enough, you can do anything.</p>
